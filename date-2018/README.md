## Reconfigurable Asynchronous Pipelines: from Formal Models to Silicon

Accepted to Design, Automation and Test in Europe (DATE) conference, 2018.

### Abstract

*Dataflow pipelines* are widely used in the design of high-throughput
computation systems. Real-life applications often require *dynamically
reconfigurable pipelines* to differently process data items or adjust to the
current operating mode. Reconfigurable synchronous pipelines are known since
1980s and are well supported by formal models and tools. *Reconfigurable
asynchronous pipelines* on the other hand, have neither a formal behavioural
model, nor mature EDA support, making them unattractive to industry. This paper
presents a model and an open-source tool for the design and verification of
reconfigurable asynchronous pipelines, and validates this approach in silicon.
